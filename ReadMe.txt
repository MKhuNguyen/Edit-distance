The file Source.cpp is made in c++ and requires a GCC compiler in order to compile and run this program.  The creator (student) made this in Visual Studio 2022 which can run the code by creating a new project and building a solution for it to be run by Visual Studio 2022.  Alternatively it can be run using the shell by using the command line.  After traversing to where the code is located in your computer using "cd", then use the following command "$ g++ -o <name-you-want-to-give> source.cpp".  Then it can simply be run by doing "./<name-you-want-to-give>" with <name-you-want-to-give> being any name you desire.  
The code then prompts the user to enter the first word and after entering the first word, it then prompts for the second word to be entered into the console.  From there it will calculate the edit distance of the two words with the second word on the horizontal axis adn the first word on the vertical axis.  It will then give the minimum edit distance and show the alignment of the two words.  

Known errors: It won't know if a match has already been made in the same path like with the two words "banana" and "na" it will output an edit distance of 3 when it is actually 4.
